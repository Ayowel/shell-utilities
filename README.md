This is a repository of utility functions commonly used in scripts. They are specialised for use in bash scripts at the moment, PR for generalisation to other shells are welcome.

## Usage

Usage from source relies on inclusion with `source` or `.`. Depending on your use-case, you might want to copy the functions you want to use instead.
