This is a repository of utility functions commonly used in scripts. They are specialised for use in bash scripts at the moment, PR for generalisation to other shells are welcome.

## Usage

Usage from source relies on inclusion with `source` or `.`. Depending on your use-case, you might want to copy the functions you want to use instead.

## Tooling

For code linting, we rely on [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).

For documentation, we rely on [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) with the [bash-doxygen](https://github.com/Anvil/bash-doxygen) filter for shell compatibility
